Prompt:

Title: UI for File Transfer project - Python 2.7 - IDLE 

Scenario: You recently created a script that will check a folder for new or modified files, and then copy those new or modified files to another location.

Users are asking for a user interface to make using the script easier and more versatile.

Desired features of the UI: 
- Allow the user to browse to and choose a specific folder that will contain the files to be checked daily. 
- Allow the user to browse to and choose a specific folder that will receive the copied files. 
- Allow the user to manually initiate the 'file check' process that is performed by the script. 

You have been asked to create this UI. 

Guidelines: 
Use Python 2.7 for this drill. 
Use wxPython to create the UI. 
The layout of the UI is up to you.
