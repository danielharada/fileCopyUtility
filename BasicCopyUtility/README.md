Script to copy files created/modified in previous 24 hours

===

Prompt:

Title: Daily File Transfer scripting project - Python 2.x - IDLE

Scenario: Your company's users create or edit a collection of text files throughout the day. These text files represent data about customer orders.

Once per day, any files that are new, or that were edited within the previous 24 hours, must be sent to the home office. To facilitate this, these new or updated files need to be copied to a specific 'destination' folder on a computer, so that a special file transfer program can grab them and transfer them to the home office.

The process of figuring out which files are new or recently edited, and copying them to the 'destination' folder, is currently being done manually. This is very expensive in terms of manpower.

You have been asked to create a script that will automate this task, saving the company a lot of money over the long term.

Guidelines:
Use Python 2.x for this drill.
You should create two folders; one to hold the files that get created or modified throughout the day, and another to receive the folders that your script determines should be copied over daily.
